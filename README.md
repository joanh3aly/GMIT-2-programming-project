The minimum standard for this project is a git repository containing a README, a gitignore file and a Jupyter notebook. The README need only contain an explanation of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook. Your notebook should contain the main body of work and should list all references used in completing the project.
A good submission will be clearly organised and contain concise explanations of the particularities of the data set. The analysis contained within the notebook will be well conceived, interesting, and well researched. Note that part of this project is about the use of Jupyter notebooks and so you should make use of all the functionality available in the software including images, links, code and plots. You may use any Python libraries that you wish, whether they have been discussed in class or not.
