The minimum standard for this project is a git repository containing a README, a gitignore file and a Jupyter notebook. The README need only contain an explanation of what is contained in the repository and how to run the Jupyter notebook. Your notebook should contain the main body of work and should list all references used in completing the project.
A good submission will be clearly organised and contain concise explanations of the particularities of the data set. The analysis contained within the notebook will be well conceived, interesting, and well researched. Note that part of this project is about the use of Jupyter notebooks and so you should make use of all the functionality available in the software including images, links, code and plots. You may use any Python libraries that you wish, whether they have been discussed in class or not.


This project must be opened using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Notebooks come installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Research

- Try to provide clear evidence that you developed new knowledge and skills while completing the assignment.

- Make sure to search online for various approaches to the problem, including other people's attempts at solving a similar problem. Summarise the results of this search in the project documentation.

- Use concepts and skills you learned in other subjects. The ability to tie all your various modules together is important.

Development

- Your comments should be clear, unambiguous and neat.

- Make sure you demonstrate an understanding the various tools, libraries and technologies you are using in your assignment.

- Any files included in your submission should have appropriate names and the layout of your submission should be clear and intuitive. A reviewer of your submission should be able to easily grasp its layout.

Consistency

- You should draw up a plan for completing an assignment and make the plan evident in your submission. You should try to stick to this plan, and your project timeline should clearly demonstrate your work towards it.

Documentation

- There is a tendency for students to focus on the programming aspect of projects, while neglecting documentation. This is a mistake, as a key aspect of work is communicating with others. Make sure another person looking at your work can easily grasp your ideas.

- You should demonstrate how design choices were made at the very beginning of the project, before any code was written, and how at the end of the project you reflected on your work.
