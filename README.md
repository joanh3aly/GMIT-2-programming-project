## Programming for Data Analysis Project 2018 ##

This notebook contains my analysis of the Gapminder dataset, and attempts to generate a similar dataset using the numpy.random package.


This project must be opened using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Notebooks come installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
